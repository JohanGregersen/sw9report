\section{CONCLUSIONS}

This paper have discussed the subject of usage-based insurance, and the metrics that are needed for a fair characterisation of drivers. It designs and implements a data warehouse with focus on the customers privacy while still facilitating insurance companies usage-based insurance billing scheme. Furthermore the authors suggests a highly customizable policy-dependant trip scoring algorithm.
The goal of the paper was to create a system targeting insurance companies who wanted to enter a new and rather unexplored market. It provides not only a method for evaluating trips through different policies, but also provides the insurance company huge statistical data on drivers.

The amount of metrics that have influence on the risk of driving cars are numerous, therefore some of the extensions of the system could be looking at more metrics. Some of the metrics could include weather data, or the physical shape of the car at checkups. Other extensions could look at fuel consumptions and pollution use these metrics.
A different direction is improving the gamification of the system. Comparison between actual trip trajectories pose some interesting and complex issues.


\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

Andersen, Krogh, Thomsen and Torp presents a data warehouse model for storing large amounts of GPS data, paired with a large quantity of dimensions to facilitate many different kinds of analysis\cite{art:gpswarehouse}. We also want to store a large amount of GPS data, but rather focus on what we can eliminate from the insurance company data collection, while still enabling advanced billing schemes. A smaller snowflake schema is therefore a valuable feature rather than a disadvantage.

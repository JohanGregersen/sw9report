Most insurance companies provides insurances based on a certain segmentation of its customers. Car insurances are often segmented into age groups dependant on historical data, however the rise in GPS technology opens new possibilities. High quality GPS-devices makes it possible to calculate different metrics, in order to characterize a certain driver. GPS-coordinates together with a timestamp and additional info is however an invasion of the privacy of the customer. In this paper we propose a set of metrics calculated from GPS-coordinates from which the insurance company can create a fair billing scheme. We propose a data warehouse which stores privacy sensitive information on the client side, while still storing sufficient data on the insurance company server for their policies. The design is fully implemented system using the PostgreSQL DBMS. The system has been developed with almost 1.9 million GPS entries, but uses real-time data for the actual implementation.

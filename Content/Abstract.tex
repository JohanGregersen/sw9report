Many insurance companies provide insurances based on segmentations of their customers. They use historical data to make statistics about which groups are more expensive than others. This method rarely provides fair insurance, both for customer and insurance company. With the rise in GPS technology, car insurance companies have new possibilities. High quality GPS-devices make it possible to use new metrics, in order to characterize individual drivers. Giving insurance companies access to GPS-coordinates with matching timestamps are however an invasion of the customer's privacy. In this paper we propose a set of metrics calculated from spatio-temporal data, from which the insurance company can create a fair billing scheme. We propose a data warehouse which stores privacy sensitive information on the client side, while still storing sufficient data on the insurance company server for their insurance policies. The design is a fully implemented system using the PostgreSQL DBMS. The system has been developed with almost 1.9 million historical entries, but uses real-time data for the actual implementation.

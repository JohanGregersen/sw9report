\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}

The rising interest, research and development of GPS devices, have increased potential market significantly. With cheaper devices comes a larger number of potential applications. Having constant feeds of GPS coordinates of the vehicle network in real-time with high accuracy gives the market some unique feats that makes it interesting for a broader spectrum of companies.

Insurance companies are one of the newer additions to this spectrum of companies. Car insurances has traditionally been based on the facts available at the time of purchase. Insurance companies will usually require detailed information about you and your car, creating an offer based on that. Coupled with historical statistics, an insurance company can make reasonable predictions about risks associated with insuring your car. For example, statistics often show young drivers being involved in more accidents compared to others\cite{accidents}.

Basing insurance on such loose prediction criteria is unfair for the individual policy holder. The generalization that young people are bad drivers means that even those who drive very well, have to pay extra because of those who do not. The problem is not unrecognised, and it is also being addressed by both insurance companies and researchers (See \ref{sec:RelatedWork}).

Insurance companies have always had historical data of what makes a driver more likely to be a poor driver. Looking at this data will clearly state different trends\cite{url:forbes}, e.g. driving at friday or saturday nights, or being young will make you more likely to be participant in an accident. Real-time data feeds offers a lot of information, such as the customers driving patterns, e.g. how steady speed the customer often has, how often he is speeding or even how often he hard he normally brakes.

To make insurance fairer, it makes sense to look at individuals rather than segmented groups. If risk prediction could be calculated based on the use of individual cars, that also means the policy holder could receive a fair price offer. This type of insurance is known as Usage Based Insurance (UBI) or Pay-As-You-Drive(PAYD), and a few insurance companies is already offering it as a product. By example, the American company \texttt{Progressive} sells UBI in select states under the name \texttt{Snapshot}\cite{snapshot}. The insurance depends on their own device mounted in your cars OBD-II port, which then measures how much you drive, number of hard braking events and more.

A common factor for any UBI system is the requirement for certain hardware in insured cars. The insurance company needs data, which the device must provide. The data is usually sent directly from the device to the insurance company, which is also the case in before mentioned example. This model can however be a concern for the policy holder. The data can be inaccessible, since it is sent directly to the insurance company. It then depends on the insurance company which data the policy holder can see, and it might not be possible to verify if you are being billed correctly. Furthermore, it is not transparent which data the insurance company actually has on your car. In Progressive's example it can be read from their FAQ that "some devices collect location data", which may be a privacy concern, especially given that the data can not be accessed.

In this paper the authors suggest how to alleviate concerns of the policy holder, while still maintaining a logical model that works for the insurance company. The data warehouse has to been implemented with a efficient and easy querying in mind. The authors look into which data is needed by the insurance company, and how it can be sent to them without being able to track policy holders too closely. There is a presentation of a series of metrics, made possible through collected vehicle data, and provide intuitive ways to visualize them for the policy holder.

The main challenges in achieving these goals lies in data management, both for supporting different metrics, but also for privacy-friendly alteration. Data presentation is also a significant challenge, as raw log data will have to be displayed in a way that the policy holder can relate and understand.
